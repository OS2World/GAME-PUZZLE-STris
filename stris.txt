IMPORTANT
---------

This is the readme  file for STris,  which should normally  be read *first*.
Since no one usually bothers  to read this file, however, it merely contains
this basic warning:

You *must* have the OS/2 MMPM/2 extensions and support installed. This is an
important  prerequisite  in order to provide  event sounds in the game,  and
STris will complain with various  errors if the sound support is not present
or properly installed on your system.

More detailed information  can be found by referring to the online help from
the STris menu.



                               Have fun with STris
